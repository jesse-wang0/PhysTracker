# PhysTracker
A video analysis and modelling CLI tool/GUI for physics education purposes.

## Description
The video processing tool is designed to analyze and visualize data from video files. Uses semi-automated tracking to calculate position, velocity and acceleration data.

Key Features:

- File Handling: Allows users to select and load video files using a file dialog.
- Video Analysis: Processes video files to extract and analyze relevant data, such as blob detection, velocity, and acceleration calculations.
- Data Visualization: Integrates matplotlib to display graphs and tables based on video analysis results.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Utilizes tkinter and ttkbootstrap to create a multi-page application for easy navigation and interaction.
